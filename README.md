# Flatiron-The-Game
A point-and-click adventure with a RoR backend and JS front-end. The story follows my experience at Flatiron School during coronavirus social distancing. Developed with Gary Lau.

# Backend
A Ruby on Rails API containing the skills, events, items, and non-player characters inside of the game. More 'events' need to be created to complete the story.

# Frontend
Created using HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, with a little animation help from GSAP. JS is responsible for game logic and navigation. Once more events are created on the backend, I'll be able to complete the game logic.
